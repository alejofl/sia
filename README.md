# Artificial Intelligence Systems

This repository will host all of the code developed as part of the curriculum of Artificial Intelligence Systems from Instituto Tecnológico de Buenos Aires (ITBA).

Each directory contains a different project:

* `tp1`: implementation of a search engine designed to solve the Sokoban puzzle using various search methods (BFS, DFS, Greedy & A*). The goal is to find the most efficient solution in terms of the number of moves required to complete the puzzle.
* `tp2`: implementation of a genetic algorithm engine designed to find the best individual for a role-playing game. The goal is to maximize the individual's attributes (strength, skill, intelligence, courage and physique) while staying within a budget.
* `tp3`: implementation of a neural network engine designed to solve different problems using a single-layer and multilayer perceptron. The goal is to classify input data or solve regression problems using supervised learning algorithms.
* `tp4`: implementation of a few unsupervised learning algorithms. With focus on associative memory and dimensionality reduction, we implemented Kohonen Self Organizing Maps, Oja Rule and Hopfield Networks.
* `tp5`: implementation of a deep learning engine that uses autoencoders to solve three different problems: reduction of dimensionality of 7x5 images of letters, denoising of 7x5 images of letters, and generation of new emojis based on a dataset of eight 20x20 PNG images.

All of the projects were carried out by:

* [Alejo Flores Lucey](https://github.com/alejofl)
* [Andrés Carro Wetzel](https://github.com/AndresCarro)
* [Ian Franco Tognetti](https://github.com/itognetti)
* [Matías Daniel Della Torre](https://github.com/matidellatorre)
