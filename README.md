# Artificial Intelligence Systems

This repository will host all of the code developed as part of the curriculum of Artificial Intelligence Systems from Instituto Tecnológico de Buenos Aires (ITBA).

Each directory contains a different project:

* `tp1`: implementation of a search engine designed to solve the **Sokoban** puzzle using various search methods (BFS, DFS, Greedy & A*). The goal is to find the most efficient solution in terms of the number of moves required to complete the puzzle.
* `tp2`: TBD.
* `tp3`: TBD.
* `tp4`: TBD.
* `tp5`: TBD.

All of the projects were carried out by:

* [Alejo Flores Lucey](https://github.com/alejofl)
* [Andrés Carro Wetzel](https://github.com/AndresCarro)
* [Ian Franco Tognetti](https://github.com/itognetti)
* [Matías Daniel Della Torre](https://github.com/matidellatorre)
